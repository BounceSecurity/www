### Exercises

**[Back to top ↑](#top)**

To bring the course to life and let you apply what you learn, you will work in teams (or individually if you prefer) on table-top exercises which simulate a variety of real challenges and situations which you might come across when building a software security program. These exercises are based on our highly successful model from previous courses and give you the opportunity to plan your approach and also explain and justify your decisions to simulated stakeholders.

To support your work on the exercises, you will receive copies of our in-house developed worksheets and tools that we use with development organisations to focus on what matters. You can then take these back with you and customise them for your own organisations.
