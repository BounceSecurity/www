### High level course explanation

You bought the application security tools, you have the findings, but now what? Many organisations find themselves drowning in “possible vulnerabilities”, struggling to streamline their processes and not sure how to measure their progress. If you are involved in using SAST, DAST or SCA tools in your organisation, these may be familiar feelings to you and this course comes to try and address these issues.

This is a topic I have had significant experience with over the last several years providing application security consulting and “on the ground” assistance to various organisations. This has exposed me to a variety of these tools and several ways of working with them, seeing what works and what does not in different contexts. Being a consultant means I have no vendor allegiance or commitment and allows me to discuss useful war stories (both successful and less successful) without disclosing sensitive client/employer information.

From seeing these organisations and discussing in various forums, this problem certainly seems to resonate and training like this would fill a gap that urgently needs to be addressed. Companies are being told that they need to improve their application security posture and that more tools are the key to doing this efficiently. However, it is becoming clear that without effective processes and strategies for working with these tools, they quickly become a burden and a blocker.
