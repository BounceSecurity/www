#### Introduction

In this post I introduce this blog series and give you an overview of what it is about and why I wanted to write it.

#### Background

This is a series of articles about our experiences submitting, preparing and delivering training at Black Hat (and other conferences as well such as [OWASP Global Appsec conferences](https://owasp.org/events) and [NDC Security](https://ndc-security.com/)). I have had this series in mind for a while now but only really felt ready to start writing whilst sitting on a plane recently.

The last couple of years have taken me on a quite surreal journey which I never expected and I have learnt a lot along the way. I am hoping that this series of articles will inspire and inform anyone who is considering doing something similar whilst also acting as a useful reference and planning aid.

#### Chapters in the series

The series is split into a set of posts. The posts chapters are roughly chronological but I would strongly recommend that you read all the way through the series before you decide whether this journey is definitely for you.

The posts are planned as follows:

- Introduction (this blog)
- What was my motivation? What motivation do you need?
- How do the financials work for a training course
- What is the niche/selling point for your course?
- Planning the practical side, how will you make it fun?
- How should you write your submission to increase the chance of acceptance?
- How can you sell/market your course?
- What preparations are you going to want to make before you travel?
- What was my experience like and what should you expect?

You can see the list of the currently written posts <a href="#top">at the top of this page</a>.

If you have feedback or questions or there are particular things you would like me to cover or you would like make suggestions, please feel free to get in contact with me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoshCGrossman) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcgrossman/). This will be an evolving set of posts so be sure to follow me if you want to find out when new posts come out!

#### My motivation

With all that being said, in the next post I will give you some personal background about how I got into delivering public training courses and why.
