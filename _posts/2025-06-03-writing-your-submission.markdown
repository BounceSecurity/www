# Writing a Convincing Call for Training (CfT) Submission

Youâ€™ve nailed your finances, carved out your niche, and built exercises that pack a punch. Now comes a critical step: getting your course accepted by a conference.

In this post, weâ€™ll dive into how to write a compelling Call for Training (CfT) submission that catches the eye of both review boards and potential attendees.

## Plan Ahead: Timing is Everything

CfTs (Calls for Training) often open earlier than the main Call for Papers (CfP). For example, Black Hat and OWASP usually open their CfTs more than **six months** before the event â€” and they might only stay open for a month.

Failing to plan here could mean missing your window altogether.

- Put CfT dates in your calendar.
- Prepare your materials well in advance.
- Treat this like a launch deadline â€” because it is.

## Know Your Audiences

Crafting a strong CfT submission requires you to speak to **two distinct audiences**:

### 1. The Conference Review Board

This group is experienced, discerning, and reviewing dozens (if not hundreds) of submissions.

What they care about:
- How your course **stands out** from the rest.
- Its **technical depth** and relevance.
- Your **credibility** as a trainer.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Include testimonials, past success stories, and why you're uniquely positioned to teach this subject.

### 2. Your Potential Attendees

Theyâ€™ll often only see a small portion of your submission â€” usually the **abstract** or **summary**.

What they want to know:
- "Is this course **useful** to me?"
- "Will it help me solve **real problems**?"
- "Will I walk away with **tangible skills**?"

Also consider: they may need to **justify this course to their manager**, so clarity and value are key.

## Writing for Both: Key Tips

Here's my approach to balancing both needs:

- Keep it short, **punchy**, and **scannable**.
- Address a **relatable pain point**: make your reader think, "That's me!"
- Be clear on **what participants will do** during the course.
- Inject some **fun** â€” enthusiasm sells.
- Highlight clear, **actionable takeaways**.

## Align with Conference Guidance

Each conference has its own:

- **Priorities**
- **Audience expectations**
- **Submission formatting rules**

Read the CfT guidelines **carefully**. Align your submission accordingly. If the guidance includes sample abstracts or criteria, **follow them closely**.

## For First-Time Trainers

New to training? Youâ€™ll likely need to prove you can **teach effectively**.

For example:
- Black Hat asks new trainers to submit **~60 slides** of material.
- They may ask for **videos**, **ratings**, or **testimonials**.

Donâ€™t leave this to the last minute. Gather evidence of your training abilities early.

## Mission Essential Task List (METL)

ðŸ§  **This is a must.** 

A METL is a detailed course breakdown â€” how long you'll spend on each topic and what will be covered.

This shows youâ€™ve done more than brainstormed ideas â€” you've **structured** the course logically.

What to include:
- Topic breakdowns with time estimates
- Lecture-to-exercise ratio
- How learning outcomes map to course segments

ðŸ’¬ As a former CfT reviewer, I can tell you: if your submission lacks this level of clarity, itâ€™s unlikely to make the cut.

## Get Feedback Before You Submit

Even seasoned trainers benefit from a second pair of eyes.

Tips:
- Ask a **former CfT reviewer** if possible.
- At the very least, someone familiar with the material.
- If English isnâ€™t your first language, get a **native speaker** to review.

At Bounce Security, our internal review process made a huge difference â€” right down to workshop titles and tagline polish.

## Add Goodies (If You Can)

Extras can make your course more appealing:

- Hardware courses might include take-home **toolkits**.
- Some courses provide pre-configured **VMs** or helpful documents.
- One course at Black Hat even included a **laptop** for every attendee (ambitious, but memorable!).

I include special working documents in my course. Weâ€™ve also considered offering **follow-up consulting hours** â€” though we havenâ€™t pulled the trigger yet.

These little bonuses show you **care** about participant success.

## The Waiting Game

Once you've submittedâ€¦ now you wait.

ðŸ“‰ Donâ€™t be discouraged by rejections â€” they happen to all of us.

Iâ€™ve been rejected multiple times by Black Hat Asia, despite prior acceptances at Black Hat EU. Keep refining, learning, and **trying again**.

Always ask for feedback (if available) and **iterate** on your submission.

## Coming Up: Selling Your Course

ðŸŽ‰ If you got accepted â€” congrats! Thatâ€™s huge.

But now comes the next big challenge: **getting people to sign up**.

In the next post, Iâ€™ll break down how to market your course effectively and turn your hard work into a full classroom.

Stay tuned!
