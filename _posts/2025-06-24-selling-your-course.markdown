# Promoting Your Course After Acceptance: What Really Works?

So your course got accepted? **Congratulations!** 🎉 That’s a huge win and shows your proposal resonated with the review board. But now comes the real challenge — **getting people to actually attend**.

In this post, I’ll share the hurdles I faced, what worked (and didn’t), and offer some practical advice to help you boost your course’s visibility. I won’t claim to be a marketing guru — your mileage may vary — but I hope these insights will help you navigate this often overlooked stage.

## Size of the Field, Size of the Audience

Before diving into promotion tactics, it's worth understanding the competitive landscape. Three big factors influence how easy or hard it will be to sell your course:

- How many people usually attend training at the conference?
- How many **other** courses are being offered?
- Can you attract people to attend the conference **specifically for your course**?

For example:

- **OWASP Global AppSec** events often run up to 10 courses in parallel, with around 100 attendees total.
- **Black Hat USA**, on the other hand, may feature **~140** courses. I remember seeing a lunch room packed with **1,000+ people** during training days.

That may sound promising, but note that **distribution isn’t equal**. Some courses are held in huge rooms with dozens of students, while others are tucked away with small groups.

This makes it crucial to **stand out**. Here’s what I tried:

- Gave my course an *optimized title* to appear higher on the course list.
- Added a **video** to the course description where allowed (more on that later).

I can’t say it dramatically boosted my numbers — but who knows what would’ve happened if I had named it “Zebra Security Essentials”? 🤷‍♂️

Bottom line: **don’t rely solely on being listed on the website**.

## What You Actually Get from the Conference

Many conferences do **minimal marketing** for individual courses.

- OWASP and Black Hat might tweet or post once or twice on LinkedIn.
- I haven’t trained at TyphoonCon, but it’s one of the few I’ve seen doing **promoted tweets for individual courses**.

You can sometimes ask organizers to amplify your own posts — but their support is limited and often hinges on you having a **strong social media presence**.

## Building Your Social Media Presence

If you're already active on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn, you're ahead of the game. If not, now's the time to get your name out there.

What I did:

- Increased my posting frequency ahead of the training events.
- Engaged in relevant conversations.
- Shared behind-the-scenes glimpses while developing the course.

These posts sparked **interesting discussions** and boosted my **professional visibility** — even outside the context of the training.

## Other Ways to Build Awareness

If social media isn’t your thing (or isn’t enough), here are some alternative channels I explored:

---

### 🎤 Conference Talks

Speaking at conferences — even on loosely related topics — is a great way to **build credibility** and plug your course at the same time.

I couldn’t fund travel to all overseas events, but I looked for conferences that **cover speaker expenses**.

Here’s a timeline of where I spoke:

- **October 2022** - OWASP Global AppSec San Francisco (Training + Talk)
- **January 2023** - NDC Security in Oslo + OWASP Oslo Meetup
- **February 2023** - OWASP Global AppSec Dublin (Training)
- **April 2023** - QCon London (Speaking)
- **June 2023** - DevTalks Bucharest (Speaking)

I’d often mention my course at the end of talks or during conversations at these events.

### 🎙️ Podcasts

Podcasts are another great channel — less travel, more reach.

Benefits I saw:

- Exposure to new audiences
- Valuable feedback on course content
- Deeper conversations that helped refine the material

Many podcasts welcome guest suggestions — especially if you have a **unique perspective** or topic to pitch.

---

### 💸 Paid Marketing (Spoiler: Meh)

We tried a small LinkedIn ad campaign. Honestly? No real impact.

Paid ads likely require **consistent investment and long-term strategy** to pay off. Not ideal for a one-off training session.

---

## The Hard Part: Self-Promotion is Draining

Here’s the truth — I found this part **exhausting**.

- I’m not a fan of social media pressure.
- I don’t love constant travel.
- Conference prep takes a toll on time, not just money.

All this meant I wasn't as consistent or aggressive in promoting as I could have been.

And when I asked attendees where they heard about the course?

> *"I saw it on the conference website."*  
>  
> Nearly every. single. time.

So lately, I’ve toned it down — just a few social posts and that’s it.

---

## The Stress of GO/NO-GO

As I mentioned in a previous post, there's often a **GO/NO-GO decision** looming.

- Will enough seats sell to justify running the course?
- Will it hit both your **and** the conference's break-even point?

That decision can be stressful. And a little embarrassing if the course gets pulled after a few people have already signed up.

For example, in 2023 I planned a **family vacation around Black Hat USA**. If the training had been cancelled, I’d have had to pay for my own flight — or skip the conference.

Luckily, it worked out. But I stressed about it for months. The relief I felt when Black Hat confirmed my course was running? Unreal.

## A Specialist Discipline

Let’s be real — sales and marketing is a **specialist skillset**.

You’ll find countless experts who can speak to it better than I can. But hopefully this post gave you a grounded, honest view from someone who's been in the trenches.

My most active period was late 2022 through early 2023. While I can’t say how much it changed the outcome, the opportunity to train at Black Hat and attend DEFCON made it **absolutely worthwhile**.

---

## Choose Your Own Adventure

Only you can decide how much time, energy, and budget to invest in promoting your course. What’s right for you might not be right for someone else.

If your course is confirmed — amazing! In the next post, I’ll walk through the **preparations** you’ll want to make to ensure it’s a success.
