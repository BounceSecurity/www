#### Introduction

In this section, I'll talk about how you can try and figure out if your course is going to fit into a crowded market for training courses.

#### Market Research

As I mentioned in a previous post, I was pretty familar with the market for training course in my specific area (application security) so I knew which topics were probably over-subscribed. If you do not have this level of familiarity, I would suggest you do some market research. Here are some areas you might want to consider.

##### History of training courses at the conference you are targeting

The Black Hat website has a record of the training courses which were provided going a long way back and in an easy to understand/guess URL scheme. Note that different Black Hat events have different characteristics. For example, USA is much larger than Asia and EU and has many more courses. The review boards may be different for the different courses as well. For their other events such as spring training I'm not even sure I saw a CFT. My guess is that they do those events on an invite-only basis for trainers who have historically seen good sales for their courses but I am speculating.

For OWASP, there should also be a historical record of the training courses provided and but I'm afraid you are going to have hunt around for it. (Hint, all recent OWASP websites have been based in GitHub).

I don't think I am giving away state secrets if I say that it seems unlikely that the OWASP training review board is going back through that historical record either although it may give you a picture of who your potential competion is.

For other conferences, you will have to see what information you can find.

##### Offensive Security

Offensive Secuity have a suite of courses. I will leave you to guess their primary focus but if that is your area then you may want to see how you are differentiating from their well established content. 

##### SANS courses

SANS has quite large and varied set of courses. Whilst they seem very expensive, consider that they usually last 6 days. That could also mean that if you have a shorter and cheaper course on a similar topic, you might still have an advantage.

##### Other sources

I'm sure there are other possible sources depending on your particular niche. What are you doing that can't be done through tutorial videos, self-paced labs or other cheaper learning mechanisms? 

#### Finding the niche

Again, finding that sweet spot of something that you are motivated enough about to write a whole course on and something which represents a gap in the market might be a tricky prospect but you need to be able to find a topic which is going to be interesting and novel enough for the review board but also sellable. 

How is your potential participant going to justify to their boss that this topic is important enough to spend the training and expense cost on whilst also convincing themselves that it is going to be worthwhile?

That being said, there are lots of unsolved problems in the wider cybersecurity industry. Plus, the industry is constantly moving with new developments and technologies and there is always something new and insecure to become a specialist about.

#### Next Post: Practical exercises

One of the big things that will differentiate your course is what the participants actually get to do themselves other than listening to you talk. In the next blog post, I'll go into this in more detail.
