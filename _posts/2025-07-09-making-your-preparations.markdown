# Preparing for Your Confirmed Training Course

Your course is confirmed and you’re ready to go? Fantastic! That’s a major milestone worth celebrating. 🎉 Now that you’re past the proposal phase, it’s time to shift gears and think about the practical preparations that will ensure your course is not just delivered—but delivered smoothly and memorably.

In this post, I’ll walk you through essential pre-course considerations, from visa planning to organizing handouts, so that nothing catches you off guard when it’s go time.

## Visa Considerations: More Than Just a Stamp

While not strictly a financial issue, visa planning is a *must-do* if you’re delivering a course abroad. Skipping this step could derail your training before it begins.

### Getting a Visa to Enter the Country

Ask yourself: *How easy is it for me to enter the country where I’ll be training?*

If you’re not blessed with a streamlined entry process (like the US ESTA or the upcoming EU ETIAS), start early. Some visa applications take weeks—or even months. And if there’s a backlog? Forget about it. Even the time between your course being accepted and the conference date might not be enough.

### Getting a Visa That Lets You Get Paid

Here’s where things get murky. I’m not a lawyer (technically, I’m an accountant—but I’ve never practiced), so this isn’t legal advice. However, be aware: Getting paid to train abroad might require a different visa than just attending a conference.

Check whether you'll legally be allowed to *work* (i.e. deliver training) and *get paid* while in that country. Conferences often won’t have definitive guidance on this either—so it’s your responsibility to do the homework.

## Supplementary Materials: Going the Extra Mile

Beyond your core curriculum, it’s a great idea to prepare supplementary materials that enhance the learning experience. These can include physical goodies, printed handouts, or digital resources. Let's break them down.

### Goodies and Extras

If you’ve promised participants anything extra—stickers, USB drives, branded gear—now's the time to deliver. But beware: You might not know your final headcount until right before the event.

At Black Hat 2023, my attendee numbers jumped by 50% in just two weeks.

So, plan generously. It’s better to have a few extras than run out and disappoint attendees. For expensive items, consider a cutoff: for example, *"Free hardware kit for sign-ups received 3+ weeks in advance."*

## Course Materials: Print Smart, Share Wisely

### Hard Copies: Old School but Effective

For in-person training, I’m a big fan of printed materials. When exercises require referring to multiple documents, printed copies save participants from the dreaded *Alt+Tab shuffle*.

I always print and bring these materials myself to ensure quality and timing. The exception? At Black Hat, they print a course workbook for you—nice touch!

> **Pro Tip:** Never pack your printed materials in checked luggage. Just don’t.

### Bonus Tip: Document Folders for the Win

One hack I tried and loved: I ordered plastic document folders via Amazon to the venue. Each participant got one to organize their handouts, plus some extras—like sticky dividers and branded stickers.

The feedback? Extremely positive. It’s a small gesture that makes a big difference.

### Soft Copies: Backup and Beyond

Printed materials are great during the course, but soft copies are critical for long-term reference. I provide PDFs unless I want students to edit the files themselves.

I “drip feed” exercise materials throughout the course, which adds a bit of complexity but keeps students from jumping ahead. For slides, I always ensure the numbering on the handouts matches the numbering on screen—this keeps everyone on track.

## Don’t Overthink It: Focus on Delivery

While all this prep helps, don’t lose sight of what truly matters—the *content* and the *experience*. Your delivery, your energy, and the interactions you create with participants are what make your course memorable.

Handouts and goodies? They’re just the icing on the cake.

## Looking for More?

That’s a wrap for now—but I have more ideas in the pipeline. Did you find this helpful? Let me know what you'd like to hear more about or which questions you want answered next.
