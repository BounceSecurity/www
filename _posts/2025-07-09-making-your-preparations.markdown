#### Introduction

Your course is confirmed and you are going ahead? Fantastic, that is a big achievement! In this section I will talk about some of the preparations you may want to make before your course.

#### Visa considerations

This is not a financial consideration as such but it is certainly something you want to consider if you are not a citizen of the country where you want to deliver a training course.

##### Getting a visa to enter the country

How easy will it be for you to enter the country where the training is to be delivered?

Some countries (such as the US) have challenging visa processes if you don't have the privilege of holding a passport that has a streamlined process (such as the US ESTA process or the upcoming EU ETIAS process).

If your visa process is going to be tricky, you are going to want to plan well ahead (many months). There is no guarantee that even the time between your training submission to the conference and the conference happening will be enough time if there is a big backlog.

##### Getting a visa to get paid whilst you are in the country

I am not a lawyer. I am in fact technically an accountant but I have never actually practiced accountancy, let alone international tax/employment law or anything else. You should perform your own due diligence to ascertain whether there is any difficulty in getting paid by a conference to train in the country where you are doing so, especially if you personally are receiving the payment.

In my experience, conferences will not be able to provide you a detailed perspective or definite guidance on this.

#### Supplementary materials for the course

I usually prepare some other materials to provide to participants at the course.

##### Goodies and extras

If you promised extra things to participants, you need to make sure you follow through on this now! The tricky part is that you may not know how many attendees will be at the course until a couple of days before. At Black Hat in 2023, my attendee numbers jumped by 50% in the last two weeks.

You are therefore going to have to make an estimate early enough to prepare what you need. I would always aim high as I'd rather have some stuff left over than leave attendees disappointed. If your materials are particularly expensive, you may need to define a cutoff in the course information, i.e. free laptop to anyone who signs up at least three weeks before the course.

##### Course Materials

I personally like to have printed materials for my in-person courses. In the exercises for my course, there are few different documents which participants need to refer to so it is a lot easier to do this with hard copies rather than constantly alt-tabbing between different screens on a laptop.

I always prepare these in advance and take them with me rather than trying to get them printed on site so that I know that it is in my control. The only exception is that Black Hat will print a course workbook as part of the service which I think is a nice addition.

Take my advice and don't send your printed materials in checked luggage...

Since participants receive a bunch of printed materials, something I did on one occasion was to get Amazon to deliver a bunch of plastic document folders to the training location. This meant that participants had a folder to put their handouts in plus I could give them a bunch of stickers and other bits of pieces such as sticky dividers which they could use to mark important pages in the training workbook.

##### Soft copies

I always make sure that attendees have soft copies of all materials as well so that they can refer to them afterwards. I will generally hand out PDFs unless I specifically want people to be able to edit the documents for themselves. I generally "drip feed" out the documents for the exercises as each exercise comes up which makes things a little more complicated for me but avoids any reading ahead. It isn't really practical do this for the slides.

One important thing for the slides (whether soft-copy or hard-copy) is that I always want the numbering on the handouts to match the numbering on screen to make it easier for participants to track where we are up to.

##### Don't overthink it

Plan in advance but don't go too overboard on these preparations. Ultimately the key to the course's success will be how well you deliver the content and the quality of the interactive experience. What you hand out to participants is just the icing on the cake!

#### Looking for more?

This is what I have so far. I have some other thoughts so let me know if you found this useful and maybe I will see what else I can think of. Alternatively, let me know what topics you would like to hear about or what questions you would like answered!
