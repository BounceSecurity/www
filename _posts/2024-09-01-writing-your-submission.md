#### Introduction

So, you figured out your financials, what you want your niche to be, and the exercises that will make your course unforgettable. Now you need to actually get accepted by a conference. In this post, I will talk about writing a convincing Call for Training (CfT)submission.

#### Plan ahead

You will want to keep an eye out for when CfTs open and closed. CfTs for Black Hat and OWASP tend to open and close before the main Call for Papers (CfP). This makes perfect sense as it is important to maximise the amount of time you have to sell tickets for the training course.

The CFT for Black Hat in particular usually opens more than 6 months before the conference and is only open for about a month. As such, you want to make sure you are ready in time.

This obviously makes advance planning and calendar awareness very important. 

#### Your two audiences

Before you start writing, it is critical to remember that you are writing for two audiences.

##### The conference review board

Firstly you are writing for the conference review board. Luckily you generally have lots of space to provide them with information about the course to try and differentiate it from the many other submissions they are reviewing. They will generally be quite experienced in the industry and may be hard to impress.

You are going to have to convince them that it is a worthwhile and sophisticated addition to the conference which is different to what is already on offer and topical.

I generally provide some background here on why I think this topic is super important, why I am an ideal person to train about it and how the course has performed at previous venues including testimonials.

##### Your potential attendees

Secondly, you are writing for your potential attendees. They will usually only see a sub-set of the information you provide so you need to ensure that you include the write information to help them make a decision. You may also have character/word limits to comply with here (although I invite you to compare the Black Hat abstract word limit to the abstracts on the training pages.)

They obviously have similar but different concerns to the review board. They care less about how the course fits in the overall picture of the conference schedule and more about how this course is going to be interesting or useful to them. You want to be able to clearly articulate the value they are taking away from the course. 

Arguably the third audience is your potential attendee's manager who they are going to have to justify the course to but I think the considerations are similar to those of the potential attendee. To be absolutely clear, you are writing a sales pitch and you need to be thinking and writing accordingly.

My general approach to this has been a few key points:

* Keep the text short, punchy and easy to read
* Try and talk about a relatable pain point - you want your attendee thinking "yes that's me, I have that challenge, I'd like to learn how to solve it".
* Help the attendee understand what they will be doing during the course.
* Make it sound fun!
* Make the take-aways clear.

#### Conference guidance

Most conferences will provide guidance on what they are looking for. Make sure you have carefully read that and written your submission accordingly.

Each conference will have its own specific perspective and content that it is looking for. If you are clearly not aligned with that, your submission may be doomed from the start.

This can also be useful as it may provide examples of what they are looking for in a submission or even examples of previous good quality submissions.

#### Pre-requisites for new trainers

Be prepared that if you are a new trainer you may need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to train effectively.

For example, Black Hat requests new trainers to provide ~60 slides of training material plus other information as well so make sure you have that ready in time for the CfT as well.

Any prior experience or videos or whatever else you can provide at this stage will help if you are not a well known trainer. I have also provided ratings and testimonials I have received when training and speaking at other venues.

#### Mission Essential Task List (METL)

Full credit for this point has to go to Daniel Cuthbert from the Black Hat Training Review board who has made it clear on a number of occasions that this is something he expects to see from submissions. Also to Avi my boss at Bounce Security who has made this standard procedure within Bounce for training course preparation.

To paraphrase, the idea of the METL is to basically provide a detailed outline of the topics to be covered during the course and the time to be spent on each topic, down to a pretty detailed level.

This shows that your course submission is not just a collection of ideas but rather it is already structured and planned with a sensible amount of time planned for each topic. It also gives an opportunity to demonstrate the split of lectures to practical exercises.

As a former CfT reviewer, I can also confirm that if I cannot feel confident that the submitter understands what is involved in delivering a training course of a day or longer, then I am going to have a hard time recommending it for acceptance.  

#### Get pre-submission feedback

Try and get feedback from someone else before you submit. If it is someone who has reviewed CFTs in the past and can give practical feedback then that is even better. However, anyone who is familiar with the material can provide highly valuable feedback. If the language you are submitting in isn't your first language then maybe get someone who has it as "mother tongue" to review for you as well. 

Certainly, my submissions have primarilly been successful due to the extensive internal feedback cycles we had here at Bounce to craft the message. Even down to discussing different course title options for catchiness and effectiveness.

It is highly unlikely you will get feedback from the conference or the review board during the CfT process, regardless of how early you submit. It is possible you might be able to get some feedback if the submission gets rejected but that is already a little too late...

#### Goodies and extras

Maybe also consider at this stage what extras you can bring to the course to sweeten the deal.

At least one Black Hat course provides participants with a laptop (to take home) rather than have to stress about setting up an environment for them but that is potentially a little extreme!

Other courses that are more physical or hardware based have given participants toolkits or electronics kits to take home.

For my course, aside from the materials from the exercises and the slides of course, participants also receive some special working documents that we prepared to help them work with the specific tools. I also considered offering some consulting time although that is not something we have tried yet.

#### Playing the waiting game

Once you have submitted, it's time to play the waiting game and hope you get accepted.

I have been rejected multiple times, even after I have been accepted at previous events from the same organization. E.g. I have never been accepted by Black Hat Asia and was accepted by Black Hat EU a couple of year but then rejected the following year.
