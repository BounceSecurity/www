#### Introduction

Welcome to a new blog series exploring the process of preparing, submitting, and delivering training courses at conferences such as [Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/trainings/), [OWASP Global AppSec conferences](https://owasp.org/events), and [NDC Security](https://ndc-security.com/). In this introductory post, I will provide an overview of what this series entails and share the inspiration behind it.

#### Background

![image](/assets/img/bhseries/trainer.png){: .blog-image}

The idea for this series has been on my mind for some time, but it was only during a recent flight that I felt ready to begin writing. Over the past few years, I have embarked on an unexpected journey that has been both rewarding and challenging. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights and lessons that I am eager to share.

This series aims to inspire and guide individuals considering a similar endeavor, offering practical advice and serving as a planning resource. Whether you are contemplating delivering a course or simply curious about the process, I hope these posts provide clarity and motivation.

#### Chapters in the Series

The blog series is structured into chapters that follow the chronological steps of my journey. While the posts are designed to be read sequentially, I recommend reading the entire series to gain a comprehensive understanding before deciding if this path aligns with your goals.
