#### Introduction

In the previous post, I briefly mentioned the financial rewards (or lack thereof) of delivering training courses. In this post, I want to dive a little more deeply into this topic.

#### Making your millions

IMHO Building training courses is not the way to make your millions. Training courses take a lot of upfront investment and then require constant "care and feeding". Things you might have to do include:

- Update material based on new industry developments.
- Update material based on your updated experience
- Check that training exercises still work
- Update technology aspects of training exercises
- Update training exercises to keep them relevant
- Apply feedback and lessons learnt from previous course runs

If you can find a topic which is generic enough to be widely applicable, different enough to what is already on the market so that there is demand for it, and also doesn't require a lot of care and feeding, then maybe you have an opportunity for a highly profitable course.

But let me know if you do manage that as it is pretty tough...

From our perspective, the course is a little niche. The "care and feeding" is not huge but I have only really delivered the course 5-8 times.

#### Covering some/all of your investment

Just doing this may be challenging enough. One thing that I did was to start off writing the content gradually by first delivering a 1 hour overview for the Open Security Summit and then a 1 day version of the course at a virtual OWASP Global AppSec.

Both times allowed me get a feeling for how the material came across and in the case of the 1 day course, I was able to try out the (slightly experimental) exercises as well (more on that later).

Again, I was not necessilly covering the time investment at this stage but at least I was getting validation that the course was worthwhile and effective.

Ultimately, you need to balance between investing enough to validate the concept and also demonstrate that it can work, whilst also not incurring a large up-front investment for something that won't work.

#### Breaking even on an individual course

This is one area where we really could not compromise. Of course, if you are able to afford to deliver training "for the exposure", then that is easier.

For a virtual course this is a lot easier as I just needed to cover the time cost to deliver it which is a lot easier.  

##### Basic break-even

For in-person training, we had to figure out what our break even point was. Specifically, how many people need to register to get the revenue required to break even. Obviously the first thing you need to know is what share of the course income you will receive from the venue which is hosting the training. (You may be able to negotiate this in certain cases).

You can then start building your profit calculator based on your expected expenses. I usually prepare an Excel spreadsheet/Google Doc to work this out and recalculate dynamically.

##### Think about expenses?

Black Hat pays for flights (up to a certain max) and for the hotel (although note just for the training days, not the conference days) and the per person amount you receive is also higher than other conferences. You also get a free ticket to the conference itself which is not exactly cheap :) Other conferences like OWASP will usually give trainers a free ticket as well.

Aside from hotel and flights, other expenses you might want to consider in your break even calculation could include airport transfers, meals/per-diems, things you buy for participants (I have a bunch of print-outs I prepare and hand-out over the duration of the course).

##### What about your time?

Also, if you work as a consultant, you are self-employed, or you are doing this separate to your employer, consider the "opportunity" cost. Could you be earning money doing other work during the time you are training which you now won't be able to do. Remember that it is not just the training days but also any days you spend traveling.

##### Revenue per course day

OWASP has a linear scale for multi-day courses where paticipants pay a flat amount per day so a 3 day course costs three times as much as a one day course but they also have a non-linear (but publically published) revenue share calculation.

Black Hat course costs seem to vary a little and it also appears that a 4 day Black Hat course does not cost the attendee twice as much as a 2 day course. I would presume this would also have a similar effect on the revenue share but I am speculating and I also know that Black Hat expects trainers to keep this confidential so I can't find out and I couldn't tell you even if I did.

On the other hand, at Black Hat USA you have the opportunity to run a 2 day course twice (Sat-Sun and Mon-Tues) so that might be more financially worthwhile if you can attract the required number of people to both runs. This is outside my experience so I couldn't tell you for sure.

I have also seen conferences who will pay a flat fee per course/per day (again contingent on hitting a specific minimum number of registrations.)

##### Be clear about your minimum up front

Most conferences will ask you up-front what your financial minimum is and you will have to stay in close contact with them to figure out when you make a GO/NO-GO decision.

#### Conference's break even

The conference themselves may also have a financial minimum so make sure you are clear about that. You should also check with them when they are likely to make that decision. 

Also, factor in that flight costs might increase if you are waiting for that decision before you book.

#### Next Post: Figuring out your selling point

You can make these decisions and plans but you still need to figure out how your course is going to fit into a crowded market. I'll talk about this in the next blog in the series.
