### So, you want to train at Black Hat? An Introduction

#### Introduction

This is a series of articles that I have had in mind for a while now but only really felt ready to start writing whilst sitting on a plane recently.

The last couple of years have taken me on a quite surreal journey which I never expected and I have learnt a lot along the way. I am hoping that this series of articles will inspire and inform anyone who is considering doing something similar whilst also acting as a useful reference and planning aid.

#### Chapters in the series

The series is split into a set of chapters. The chapters are roughly chronological but I would strongly recommend that you read all the way through the series before you decide whether this journey is definitely for you.

The chapters are as follows:
- Introduction (this blog)
- Who am I, what is my motivation?
- Plan your financials
- Other up-front considerations
- Writing your submission
- Selling and marketing your course.
- Making your preparations
- The experience itself.
