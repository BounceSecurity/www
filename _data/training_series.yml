title: "So you want to train at Black Hat (or other conferences)?"
description: | 
    This is a series of articles about our experiences submitting, preparing and delivering training at Black Hat (and other conferences as well).
    <br /><br />
    It has been quite the journey and it feels like we learnt a lot of things which were not obvious to us at the beginning or were just not documented.
    <br /><br />
    In this series, we will try to set this information out in an organized way to hopefully help people in the future who are interested in going through a similar journey.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>This series is complete for now</strong> but if you have questions or requests for further posts, you can contact Josh <a href="https://www.bouncesecurity.com/team-members/josh" target="_blank">via his team page</a>.
