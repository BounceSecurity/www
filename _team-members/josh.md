Josh Grossman has worked as a consultant in IT and Application Security and Risk for 15 years now, as well as a Software Developer. This has given him an in-depth understanding of how to manage the balance between business needs, developer needs and security needs which goes into a successful software security programme.

Josh is currently CTO for Bounce Security where he helps clients improve and get better value from their application security processes and provides specialist application security advice.
