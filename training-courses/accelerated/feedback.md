### Participant Feedback

This course is brand new but the concepts and exercises are closely modeled on my successful "[Building a High-Value AppSec Scanning Programme](../valuenotvulns/)" course which has received feedback including:

> _"Group exercises were awesome – everybody were involved, compensated each other’s knowledge gaps and shared experience and approaches."_

> _"Really enjoyed the experience learning from Josh and I am walking away with information and practical knowledge…to further improve my organization’s overall security posture and resiliency."_

> _“Loved the stakeholder exercises”_
