### SCA Deep Dive - Sample 1 of the course material (~55 minutes)

**[Back to top ↑](#top)**

This is an example of some of the course content albeit pushed together in a less interactive way. The course itself has more discussion and exercises interspersed. This particular session was a deep-dive on Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

### Quick-fire tips - Sample 2 of the course material (~40 minutes)

**[Back to top ↑](#top)**

This was a talk I did at DevSecCon24 which was designed to be a few quick examples of efficiency tips for SCA and SAST. In the full training course there are far more suggestions and there is much more time to explain, discuss and practice them.
