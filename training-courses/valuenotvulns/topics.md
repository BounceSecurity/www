- What to expect from these tools?
- Customising and optimising these tools effectively
- Building tool processes which fit your business

- Review of other key tool types

### Exercises

**[Back to top ↑](#top)**

To bring the course to life and let you apply what you learn, you will work in teams on table-top exercises where you design processes to cover specific scenarios, explain and justify your decisions to simulated stakeholders and practice prioritising your remediation efforts.

For these exercises, you will work based on specially designed process templates (which we will provide) which you can use afterwards to apply these improvements within your own organisation.

Be ready to work in a group, take part in discussions and present your findings and leave the course with clear strategies and ideas on how to get less stress and more value from these tools.
