Are you looking for assistance in strategizing and implementing a comprehensive Application/Product Security program for either a new venture or an expansion of an existing one?

We offer our Product Roadmapping service as a way to help you understand where you’re going, how long it will take, how much fuel (budget) you can expect to use, and what risks face us along the way.

Focusing on high-level business context and constraints, the Product Security Roadmap takes a value-driven approach to optimize investment in product security efforts. This will detail which product security activities should be prioritized in your organization, and why.

These will enable you to reduce overall risk with cost-efficient tasks aligned with overall business priorities and based on your teams’ deep understanding of their product environment and architecture.

The purpose of the Roadmap is to plan work more efficiently, ensure product security investment is aligned with what your company actually needs (instead of generic “Best Practices”), and provide a set of long-term product security targets.
